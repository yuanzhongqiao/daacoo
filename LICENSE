**PKU Open Source Agreement (PKU OSA)**  
**Public Knowledge Unit Open Source Agreement**  

The **Public Knowledge Unit Open Source Agreement (PKU OSA)** is a groundbreaking initiative spearheaded by Peking University (PKU) alumni to champion the free flow of open-source knowledge while protecting the rights and livelihoods of contributors. Designed as a visionary framework, the PKU OSA seeks to harmonize accessibility, fairness, and corporate responsibility in the global open-source ecosystem.  

### **Core Principles of the PKU OSA**  
1. **Free Access for Individuals and Small Businesses**  
   - PKU-licensed open-source projects are freely available to individual developers, startups, and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). This empowers grassroots innovation and fosters community-driven growth without financial barriers.  

2. **Standardized Licensing Fees for Large Enterprises**  
   - Mid-sized and large corporations using PKU-licensed software are required to pay a structured annual fee to the original contributors, ensuring creators receive tangible rewards for their work.  
   - **Fee Structure**:  
     - **Enterprises with annual revenue > ¥10 million but ≤ ¥100 million**: ¥5,888/year.  
     - **Enterprises with annual revenue > ¥100 million**: ¥12,888/year.  

3. **Legal and Technical Safeguards for Contributors**  
   - **Intellectual Property Protection**: The PKU OSA is underpinned by a dedicated association that automatically secures global intellectual property (IP) certifications for licensed projects, safeguarding contributors’ rights.  
   - **Usage Monitoring**: The association employs automated systems to track large enterprises’ usage of PKU-licensed software and facilitates fee collection, ensuring transparency and compliance.  

### **Addressing Key Challenges**  
The PKU OSA resolves three critical issues in the open-source landscape:  
- **Financial Sustainability for Contributors**: Ensures open-source authors receive fair compensation, addressing long-standing underpayment in the sector.  
- **Livelihood Security for Developers**: Empowers foundational software technologists to sustain independent careers through recognized technical contributions.  
- **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Integration**: Provides large enterprises with a structured channel to fulfill CSR obligations by supporting open-source innovation.  

### **Global Vision for a Thriving Open-Source Ecosystem**  
By promoting equitable access and sustainable incentives, the PKU OSA aims to:  
- Catalyze the growth of open-source communities in China and worldwide.  
- Foster a collaborative, inclusive, and prosperous tech ecosystem where knowledge remains a public good.  

### **Mission Statement**  
The PKU OSA is more than a license—it is a movement. By aligning the interests of contributors, users, and corporations, it strives to create a future where open-source innovation thrives, ensuring creators are rewarded and knowledge is shared freely.  

### **Join the PKU OSA Movement**  
Developers, enterprises, and communities are invited to adopt the PKU OSA and contribute to a more equitable, sustainable open-source world. Together, we can redefine the future of technology—one line of code at a time.
